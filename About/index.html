  <p>Hi There!
    My name is Bayley Frost, and I'm a senior in Media and Information studies at Michigan State University focusing on Website Design and Business using Media.
    
    I have always prided myself on being extremely well-rounded. When I was a kid I couldn't stand to be mediocre at anything in the world. If I found I was bad at an activity, I would practice as long as it took to become good. That quality followed me into my education, as I have now learned many different aspects of Media. I have experience in Game Design, Computer Science, Filmmaking, Graphic Design, Ecommerce, Network Security, and of course, Web Design. Web Design appealed to me the most, however, because I have an eye for spatial reasoning, love problem solving, color schemes, ease of functionability, and above all else, I love to create.</p>
