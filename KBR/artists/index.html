     <img src="sidewatcher.jpg" alt="Picture of Sidewatcher">
     <p>Sidewatcher's music is a sweetheart with a switchblade. It's the teenage girl who was ditched at prom and now has blood in her eyes. Mixed with waves of garage surf, Sidewatcher's songs have a barbie punk/prom rock vibe that take you on a trip through sick love and manipulative alien boyfriends.</p>

      <p>King Bayley (Pictured Above in the Floral Patterned shirt) is a solo artist
        known for his profound ability to storytell. A soft indie-styled vibe mixed
        with powerful emotional vocals, you will feel what he has to say. Starting 
        out in Grand Rapids, Michigan, King Bayley inherits the deep rooted traditions
        of the city and is on a mission to tell the story of a young man growing up
        within it.

      <h3>V*A*S*E</h3>
      <img src="vase.jpg" alt="Picture of V*A*S*E">
      <p>Formed in October of 2018 by guitarist cousins, J.T. Jasinski and Drew Kussmaul, V*A*S*E immediately sought to bring something new to rock music. Combining a love for early protopunk (The Stooges, Hawkwind), American post-punk (The Feelies, Sonic Youth), and the grunge boom of the 90s (Nirvana, Local H), the boys from Brighton, Michigan began the search for other musicians to fill out their sound. The permanent additions of Christian Thibodeau on vocals, Derian Parsons on bass, and Elijah Simmons on drums during the summer months of 2019 have solidified V*A*S*E as a fearsome fivesome, in the style of fellow Michigan bands, Sponge and the MC5. Building up a repertoire of originals, the band has slowly, but surely, played close to 50 shows over the past year at venues all over the state. with enough material to cover a full length album, V*A*S*E has some big things up their sleeves for the next year.</p>
